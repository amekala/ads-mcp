When working with advertising or ad campaign tasks using the Adspirer MCP tools, always follow this workflow:

1. **Always call `get_connections_status` first** before any other Adspirer tool. This checks which ad platforms (Google Ads, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok) are connected and identifies the active accounts. Never skip this step.

2. **Read before you act.** Fetch performance data or account status before creating campaigns or modifying budgets.

3. **Campaign creation requires user confirmation.** These tools create real campaigns that spend real money. Always confirm settings with the user before executing any creation or budget-changing tool.

4. **Follow platform-specific tool ordering:**
   - Google Search campaigns: `research_keywords` → `discover_existing_assets` → `validate_and_prepare_assets` → `create_search_campaign` → add extensions (sitelinks, callouts, snippets)
   - Google PMax: `discover_existing_assets` → `validate_and_prepare_assets` → `create_pmax_campaign` → add extensions
   - LinkedIn: `get_linkedin_organizations` → `discover_linkedin_assets` → `validate_and_prepare_linkedin_assets` → `create_linkedin_image_campaign`
   - Meta: `search_meta_targeting` or `browse_meta_targeting` → create campaign
   - TikTok: `discover_tiktok_assets` → `validate_and_prepare_tiktok_assets` → `create_tiktok_campaign`

5. **Never retry campaign creation automatically** on error. Report the error and wait for user input.

6. **All new campaigns must be created in PAUSED status.** Never launch a campaign without explicit user approval.

7. **Never exceed budget guardrails** from BRAND.md. If unsure about budget impact, ask the user first.

8. **Ad extensions are mandatory for Google Ads campaigns.** After creating any Google Search or PMax campaign, always add sitelinks, callout extensions, and structured snippets.
