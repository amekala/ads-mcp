## Brand Workspace Context

When working on advertising, campaign, or marketing tasks in this project:

1. **Check for BRAND.md** in the project root. If it exists, read it before answering any advertising question. It contains brand voice, audiences, KPI targets, budget guardrails, and platform status.

2. **Check for memory** at `.cursor/memory/performance-marketing-agent/MEMORY.md`. If it exists, read it for past decisions, learnings, and user preferences.

3. **If BRAND.md does not exist**, this is a new brand workspace. Use the `adspirer-setup` skill to bootstrap it — scan local docs, pull live data from Adspirer MCP, and generate BRAND.md.

4. **Brand docs** in the project folder (`.md`, `.txt`, `.csv`, `.yaml`, `.json`, `.pdf`) contain brand guidelines, media plans, and strategy notes. Read relevant files when writing ad copy, creating campaigns, or making recommendations.

5. **Always use live data** from the Adspirer MCP server alongside brand context. Never answer performance questions from memory alone — pull fresh data.

6. **Update BRAND.md** when significant changes happen (new platforms connected, new brand docs added, major strategy shifts). Update MEMORY.md after every campaign action with what was done and why.
