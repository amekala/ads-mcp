# Campaign Safety Rules
# Prevent direct API calls to ad platforms — all operations must go through Adspirer MCP
# Operational guardrails for campaign reliability:
# - Never report success until ads, keywords, and extensions are verified.
# - Use statuses: SUCCESS / PARTIAL_SUCCESS / FAILED.
# - If extension verification fails, retry once and then report PARTIAL_SUCCESS with explicit gaps.
# - Conversion action primary/secondary setup is manual in Google Ads UI (not configurable via MCP tools).
