description: Set up your brand workspace — connect to Adspirer and pull campaign data
---
Use the performance-marketing-agent agent to run the full workspace setup:

1. Connect to Adspirer ad accounts (triggers OAuth if needed)
2. Scan this folder for brand docs (guidelines, media plans, audience profiles)
3. Pull live campaign data from all connected platforms (Google Ads, Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok)
4. Create CLAUDE.md with brand context, performance snapshot, and KPI targets
5. Present a summary of what was found and what you can help with

Run the complete Workspace Setup Flow from your instructions.
